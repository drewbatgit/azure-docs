# Quickstart: Use Azure App Configuration with Python

In this quickstart, you access the Azure App Configuration service from Python in order to centralize storage and management of application settings separate from your code. For more information, see [Azure App Configuration client library for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/appconfiguration/azure-appconfiguration)

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Python 2.7, or 3.5 or later - For information on setting up Python on Windows, see the [Python on Windows documentation](/windows/python/)

## Create an App Configuration store

[!INCLUDE [azure-app-configuration-create](../../includes/azure-app-configuration-create.md)]

6. Select **Configuration Explorer** > **Create** > **Key-value** to add the following key-value pairs:

    | Key | Value |
    |---|---|
    | TestApp:Settings:Message | Data from Azure App Configuration |

    Leave **Label** and **Content Type** empty for now.

7. Select **Apply**.

## Install the Azure App Configuration client library

Use pip to install the Azure App Configuration client library for Python with pip:

```python
pip install azure-appconfiguration
```

## Store the access key in an environment variable

Set an environment variable named **ConnectionString**, and set it to the access key to your App Configuration store. At the command line, run the following command:

```cmd
setx ConnectionString "connection-string-of-your-app-configuration-store"
```

If you use Windows PowerShell, run the following command:

```azurepowershell
$Env:ConnectionString = "connection-string-of-your-app-configuration-store"
```

If you use macOS or Linux, run the following command:

```console
export ConnectionString='connection-string-of-your-app-configuration-store'
```

Restart the command prompt to allow the change to take effect. Print out the value of the environment variable to validate that it is set properly.

## Connect to an App Configuration store

1. Import the environment variable dictionary from the **os** namespace:

    ```python
    from os import environ
    ```

2. Import the Azure App Configuration client object into the current namespace:

    ```python
    from azure.appconfiguration import AzureAppConfigurationClient
    ```

3. Get the connection string from the environment variable:

    ```python
    connection_string = os.environ['ConnectionString']
    ```

4. Create the client object using the connection string

    ```python
    client = AzureAppConfigurationClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)
    ```

## Retrieve the configuration value

Retrieve the configuration value by calling **get_configuration_setting** and setting the **key** parameter to the key you configured in the Azure portal.

```python
fetched_config_setting = client.get_configuration_setting(key = 'TestApp:Settings:Message')
fetched_config_setting.value
```

> Output:
> ```python
> 'Data from Azure App Configuration'
> ```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a new App Configuration store and accessed it from Python. To learn how to configure your .NET Core app to dynamically refresh configuration settings, continue to the next tutorial.
